## Quick Start

#### 1.Requirements

Before proceeding you'll need to have the latest stable [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/).

<br/>

#### 2.Install

Open the project folder and install its dependencies. You can use any package manager you want. We recommend [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com).

```sh
cd project-folder
npm install
```

<br/>

#### 3.Start

Once the installation is done, you can now start your app by running `npm start` or `yarn start`.

```sh
npm start
```

This starts a local webserver at `http://localhost:3000` and auto detect file changes:

```sh
Compiled successfully!

You can now view @minimal/material-kit-react in the browser.

Local:            http://localhost:3000
On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.6:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.
```

<br/>

#### 4.Build

```sh
npm run build
```

or

```sh
yarn build
```

Your app is ready to be deployed. 👏
